<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>BIO_ctrl(), BIO_callback_ctrl(), BIO_ptr_ctrl() and BIO_int_ctrl() are BIO &quot;control&quot; operations taking arguments of various types. These functions are not normally called directly, various macros are used instead. The standard macros are described below, macros specific to a particular type of BIO are described in the specific BIOs manual page as well as any special features of the standard calls.</p>

<p>BIO_reset() typically resets a BIO to some initial state, in the case of file related BIOs for example it rewinds the file pointer to the start of the file.</p>

<p>BIO_seek() resets a file related BIO&#39;s (that is file descriptor and FILE BIOs) file position pointer to <b>ofs</b> bytes from start of file.</p>

<p>BIO_tell() returns the current file position of a file related BIO.</p>

<p>BIO_flush() normally writes out any internally buffered data, in some cases it is used to signal EOF and that no more data will be written.</p>

<p>BIO_eof() returns 1 if the BIO has read EOF, the precise meaning of &quot;EOF&quot; varies according to the BIO type.</p>

<p>BIO_set_close() sets the BIO <b>b</b> close flag to <b>flag</b>. <b>flag</b> can take the value BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE. Typically BIO_CLOSE is used in a source/sink BIO to indicate that the underlying I/O stream should be closed when the BIO is freed.</p>

<p>BIO_get_close() returns the BIOs close flag.</p>

<p>BIO_pending(), BIO_ctrl_pending(), BIO_wpending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() return the number of pending characters in the BIOs read and write buffers. Not all BIOs support these calls. BIO_ctrl_pending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() return a size_t type and are functions, BIO_pending() and BIO_wpending() are macros which call BIO_ctrl().</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>BIO_reset() normally returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure. File BIOs are an exception, they return 0 for success and -1 for failure.</p>

<p>BIO_seek() and BIO_tell() both return the current file position on success and -1 for failure, except file BIOs which for BIO_seek() always return 0 for success and -1 for failure.</p>

<p>BIO_flush() returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.</p>

<p>BIO_eof() returns 1 if EOF has been reached 0 otherwise.</p>

<p>BIO_set_close() always returns 1.</p>

<p>BIO_get_close() returns the close flag value: BIO_CLOSE or BIO_NOCLOSE.</p>

<p>BIO_pending(), BIO_ctrl_pending(), BIO_wpending() and BIO_ctrl_wpending() return the amount of pending data.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>BIO_flush(), because it can write data may return 0 or -1 indicating that the call should be retried later in a similar manner to BIO_write_ex(). The BIO_should_retry() call should be used and appropriate action taken is the call fails.</p>

<p>The return values of BIO_pending() and BIO_wpending() may not reliably determine the amount of pending data in all cases. For example in the case of a file BIO some data may be available in the FILE structures internal buffers but it is not possible to determine this in a portably way. For other types of BIO they may not be supported.</p>

<p>Filter BIOs if they do not internally handle a particular BIO_ctrl() operation usually pass the operation to the next BIO in the chain. This often means there is no need to locate the required BIO for a particular operation, it can be called on a chain and it will be automatically passed to the relevant BIO. However this can cause unexpected results: for example no current filter BIOs implement BIO_seek(), but this may still succeed if the chain ends in a FILE or file descriptor BIO.</p>

<p>Source/sink BIOs return an 0 if they do not recognize the BIO_ctrl() operation.</p>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>Some of the return values are ambiguous and care should be taken. In particular a return value of 0 can be returned if an operation is not supported, if an error occurred, if EOF has not been reached and in the case of BIO_seek() on a file BIO for a successful operation.</p>
