<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Some engines are able to process multiple simultaneous crypto operations. This capability could be utilised to parallelise the processing of a single connection. For example a single write can be split into multiple records and each one encrypted independently and in parallel. Note: this will only work in TLS1.1+. There is no support in SSLv3, TLSv1.0 or DTLS (any version). This capability is known as &quot;pipelining&quot; within OpenSSL.</p>

<p>In order to benefit from the pipelining capability. You need to have an engine that provides ciphers that support this. The OpenSSL &quot;dasync&quot; engine provides AES128-SHA based ciphers that have this capability. However these are for development and test purposes only.</p>

<p>SSL_CTX_set_max_send_fragment() and SSL_set_max_send_fragment() set the <b>max_send_fragment</b> parameter for SSL_CTX and SSL objects respectively. This value restricts the amount of plaintext bytes that will be sent in any one SSL/TLS record. By default its value is SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH (16384). These functions will only accept a value in the range 512 - SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH.</p>

<p>SSL_CTX_set_max_pipelines() and SSL_set_max_pipelines() set the maximum number of pipelines that will be used at any one time. This value applies to both &quot;read&quot; pipelining and &quot;write&quot; pipelining. By default only one pipeline will be used (i.e. normal non-parallel operation). The number of pipelines set must be in the range 1 - SSL_MAX_PIPELINES (32). Setting this to a value &gt; 1 will also automatically turn on &quot;read_ahead&quot; (see <a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead.html>SSL_CTX_set_read_ahead(3)</a>). This is explained further below. OpenSSL will only every use more than one pipeline if a ciphersuite is negotiated that uses a pipeline capable cipher provided by an engine.</p>

<p>Pipelining operates slightly differently for reading encrypted data compared to writing encrypted data. SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment() and SSL_set_split_send_fragment() define how data is split up into pipelines when writing encrypted data. The number of pipelines used will be determined by the amount of data provided to the SSL_write() call divided by <b>split_send_fragment</b>.</p>

<p>For example if <b>split_send_fragment</b> is set to 2000 and <b>max_pipelines</b> is 4 then:</p>

<p>SSL_write called with 0-2000 bytes == 1 pipeline used</p>

<p>SSL_write called with 2001-4000 bytes == 2 pipelines used</p>

<p>SSL_write called with 4001-6000 bytes == 3 pipelines used</p>

<p>SSL_write called with 6001+ bytes == 4 pipelines used</p>

<p><b>split_send_fragment</b> must always be less than or equal to <b>max_send_fragment</b>. By default it is set to be equal to <b>max_send_fragment</b>. This will mean that the same number of records will always be created as would have been created in the non-parallel case, although the data will be apportioned differently. In the parallel case data will be spread equally between the pipelines.</p>

<p>Read pipelining is controlled in a slightly different way than with write pipelining. While reading we are constrained by the number of records that the peer (and the network) can provide to us in one go. The more records we can get in one go the more opportunity we have to parallelise the processing. As noted above when setting <b>max_pipelines</b> to a value greater than one, <b>read_ahead</b> is automatically set. The <b>read_ahead</b> parameter causes OpenSSL to attempt to read as much data into the read buffer as the network can provide and will fit into the buffer. Without this set data is read into the read buffer one record at a time. The more data that can be read, the more opportunity there is for parallelising the processing at the cost of increased memory overhead per connection. Setting <b>read_ahead</b> can impact the behaviour of the SSL_pending() function (see <a href="../man3/SSL_pending.html>SSL_pending(3)</a>).</p>

<p>The SSL_CTX_set_default_read_buffer_len() and SSL_set_default_read_buffer_len() functions control the size of the read buffer that will be used. The <b>len</b> parameter sets the size of the buffer. The value will only be used if it is greater than the default that would have been used anyway. The normal default value depends on a number of factors but it will be at least SSL3_RT_MAX_PLAIN_LENGTH + SSL3_RT_MAX_ENCRYPTED_OVERHEAD (16704) bytes.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>All non-void functions return 1 on success and 0 on failure.</p>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>With the exception of SSL_CTX_set_default_read_buffer_len() and SSL_set_default_read_buffer_len() all these functions are implemented using macros.</p>

<h1 id="HISTORY">HISTORY</h1>

<p>The SSL_CTX_set_max_pipelines(), SSL_set_max_pipelines(), SSL_CTX_set_split_send_fragment(), SSL_set_split_send_fragment(), SSL_CTX_set_default_read_buffer_len() and SSL_set_default_read_buffer_len() functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.</p>
